You are part of Captain James Blackwood's crew, tasked with charting new territories and rooting out piracy. After weeks at sea, a strange, mist-shrouded island appears on the horizon, absent from any known map. This uncharted territory promises both danger and opportunity. \n\n As you come ashore, you find yourselves in Shipwreck Cove, a natural harbor littered with the skeletal remains of ships lost to time and tide. The air hums with the buzz of insects and the cries of unseen birds. The jungle presses close, its emerald depths promising both beauty and peril.\n\nYour landing party consists of:\n\n1.  Lieutenant Sarah Hawkins, a skilled navigator and naturalist\n2.  Dr. Elias Thorne, the ship's surgeon and amateur botanist\n3.  Quartermaster Jack \"One-Eye\" Cooper, a grizzled veteran sailor\n4.  Midshipman Thomas Flynn, a young and eager officer\n5.  Able Seaman Maria Cortez, known for her keen eyesight and steady hands"
