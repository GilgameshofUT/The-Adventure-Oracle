If you have already learned about Tockley through a Keyed Scene, then your Character gets more information about the Manor in this Encounter. You'll need to determine two things: how you learn about Tockley, and what information is attached to it. The how can be answered through a Fate Question using what seems most logical given the Context. For instance, if your Character is in a shop in Closport and you roll this Encounter, you may determine that the owner of the store tells you about it. \"The woman behind the counter sets down the music box and leans forward, saying in a conspiratorial voice, 'Have you heard of Tockley Manor?'\"  Aside from Characters, you may also learn of the Manor through books or journals. After you determine how you learn about the Manor, you need to attach what you learn about it. This should contain some element of mystery or local legend to it. For inspiration, roll on the Action Meaning Tables. For instance, in our example above of the shopkeeper mentioning Tockley, the Player rolls on the Action Meaning Tables and gets \"waste\" and \"emotions\". You may interpret this to mean: \"She shakes her head mournfully. 'A sad place, really. Such a pity what happened to the Tockleys.'\"",

If you have already learned about Tockley through a Keyed Scene, then your Character gets more information about the Manor in this Encounter. You'll need to determine two things: how you learn about Tockley, and what information is attached to it. The how can be answered through a Fate Question using what seems most logical given the Context. For instance, if your Character is in a shop in Closport and you roll this Encounter, you may determine that the owner of the store tells you about it. \"The woman behind the counter sets down the music box and leans forward, saying in a conspiratorial voice, 'Have you heard of Tockley Manor?'\"  Aside from Characters, you may also learn of the Manor through books or journals. After you determine how you learn about the Manor, you need to attach what you learn about it. This should contain some element of mystery or local legend to it. For inspiration, roll on the Action Meaning Tables. For instance, in our example above of the shopkeeper mentioning Tockley, the Player rolls on the Action Meaning Tables and gets \"waste\" and \"emotions\". You may interpret this to mean: \"She shakes her head mournfully. 'A sad place, really. Such a pity what happened to the Tockleys.'\"",
