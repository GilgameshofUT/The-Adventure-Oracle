Produce the resolution root element in correct JSON. If the adventure gives multiple options for resolving the adventure, be sure to include all of them. You are not trying to write the resolution yourself, just give the information from the story to the player. Note the resolution element does not take a description sub-element. Here is an example of the format:

{
 "resolution": "By now you have uncovered the dark secret behind this place and established that what they are doing is morally compromised. You cannot let it continue. What are your options? A dramatic speech that turns it all around? Cold logic? A show of force? Time travel to get some humpback whales? What kind of support does Rike have? Does he have superhuman abilities? Perhaps a beautiful woman has a role to play."
}
