Now we will create the first region.

When creating regions keep the following things in mind:

There should be close to the same number of elements for locations, encounters and objects in each region.

Encounters, objects, and locations are all drawn independently of each other in random order. When describing an element do not assume other elements have already been revealed. Where possible describe encounters and objects independently of their location.  For example “a sample of metal debris from the warehouse” may become “a sample of metal debris”. If it is essential to the story to tie an object or an encounter to a specific location, then include that object or encounter in the location description rather than as a separate element. For example “a bartender” might belong only in a bar and would not make sense at a different location and would be included in the location description.

When introducing NPCs give plenty of information about who they are, their description, motivations and other things a GM would tell the player each time they appear, as it will not be certain if this is the first encounter with them. 

Keyed scenes also should be written to work with any location if possible. Sometimes a key scene might be tied to a specific place and if that is the case it is fine to include it, but if the location is not essential to the story, write it in a way that leaves the location open to multiple options.

Be sure to include all named characters and locations as elements in the region.

If an element opens travel to a new region be sure to state this in the description so the user will know.
