Your science officer agrees that it looks like an older signal using a frequency that has long been discontinued due to its rather short range. The signals are very weak, but there are energy fluctuations from the planet possibly indicating advanced technology. Previously it was believed the planet was uninhabited. You form an away team. Suggested members include your science officer, your chief medical officer, if you can convince him to step into the transporter, the captain, of course, and maybe a few crewmen wearing bright red uniforms. You go to standard orbit and beam down. The adventure begins."
